Deep Learning Adversarial Attack Project

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for our CS-GY 6953 final project on adversarial robustness of deep vision models. We evaluate and compare three white-box attack strategies (FGSM, PGD, patch) on a pretrained ResNet-34 model and assess transferability to DenseNet-121 over a subset of ImageNet-1K.
